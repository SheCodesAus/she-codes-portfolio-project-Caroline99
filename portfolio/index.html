    <p>
        Caroline is an advocate for quality in software development and enjoys honing her craft in her current role as a Test Analyst at 
        <a href=http://autogeneral.com.au>Auto & General</a>
        in Brisbane. Providing professional testing services for nearly four years, including automation, she's been testing since she was a child; always seeking improvements, testing boundaries and exploring her infinite curiosity. 
    </p>
    <p>
        As a teenager she participated in the Olympiad maths program and later earned her degree with a double major in computer science. She continues to learn about testing and coding through online and class-based courses, including the current 
        <a href=http://shecodes.com.au>She Codes Brisbane</a> 
        program. She's shared her knowledge as a tutor and in various volunteering roles, including 
        <a href=https://codeclub.org/en/>Code Club</a>
        while she was living in the UK. She also loves learning about human behaviour, neuroscience, and communication.
    </p>
    <p>
        She's traveled to over fifty countries so far and wishes that the technology of teleportation was further advanced so she didn't have to spend so much time at airports. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Caroline is a 
        <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freestyle_footbag>footbag</a> 
        freestyler and hoping that she'll be able to continue her unbroken streak and attend her 15th world championships this year. Although satisfied with her eight bronze medals, she continues to compete, knowing that “opportunity dances with those already on the dance floor”; a motto she extends beyond just footbag.
    </p>
    <p>
        She loves live music, hates pandemics, and if you like to laugh, you can join her as she straps roller-skates to her feet again, overcomes her adult fears and rediscovers the joy she found in skating as a kid.
